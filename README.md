# Bank Quantities Plugin
This plugin adds a tooltip for items in your inventory to show the current quantity of that item that you have in your bank. 

Data **will not** show in the tooltip up until you open your bank. The tooltips only show up in the inventory when the bank isn't opened

The tooltip will show below the [Item Stats plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Item-Stats) if being used.
